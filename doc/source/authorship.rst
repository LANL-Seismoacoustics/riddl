The methods in *riddl* were developed by infrasound SMEs at Los Alamos National Laboratory and are documented in Bishop et al. (2022).  For any questions on the methods, see the publication in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA).
For questions or issues with the implementation and features of the software contact:

Other in-development AI/ML-based signal analysis methods for infrasound included here are in the prototype stage. Peer reviewed citations will be added as those methods are further developed and evaluated.
